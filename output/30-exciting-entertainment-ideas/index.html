                        <h2>Types of Entertainment Businesses</h2>

                            
                        <h3>Film and Television Production</h3>
<p>Film and television production remains a cornerstone of the entertainment industry. Major studios, such as Warner Bros and Disney, produce blockbuster films that capture global audiences, while independent filmmakers are gaining recognition for their unique storytelling approaches. The emergence of streaming services has further democratized content creation, allowing diverse voices to reach viewers.</p>

                            
                        <h3>Major Studios and Independent Films</h3>
<p>Major studios are known for their high-budget productions and extensive marketing campaigns, while independent films often focus on niche storytelling and artistic expression. The rise of platforms like Sundance Film Festival has provided independent filmmakers with a stage to showcase their work and connect with audiences who crave originality.</p>

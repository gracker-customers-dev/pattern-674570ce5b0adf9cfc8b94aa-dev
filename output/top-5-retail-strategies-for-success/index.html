                        <p>Retail is the process of selling consumer goods or services directly to customers. It plays a crucial role in the economy, significantly contributing to GDP and employment rates. The retail sector encompasses a wide range of businesses that cater to consumer needs, making it a vibrant part of the economic landscape.</p>

                            
                        <p>The importance of retail cannot be overstated; it serves as the bridge between manufacturers and consumers, facilitating the distribution of goods and providing essential services. With the evolution of consumer behavior and technological advancements, retail has transformed dramatically, leading to various business types that cater to diverse consumer preferences.</p>

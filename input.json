          "In recent years, the wholesale market has evolved significantly, driven by technological advancements and changing consumer behaviors.

They often handle a wide range of products and provide services such as storage, order fulfillment, and delivery. Distributors typically work closely with manufacturers to ensure that products are available to retailers in a timely manner.",
          "### Wholesalers\nWholesalers buy goods in bulk from manufacturers or distributors and sell them in smaller quantities to retailers.

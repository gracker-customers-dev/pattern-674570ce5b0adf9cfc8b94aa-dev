                        <p>Outpatient services and clinics cater to patients who do not require overnight stays. These facilities offer services like routine check-ups, diagnostic tests, and minor surgeries. They play a significant role in preventive care and managing chronic conditions, making healthcare more accessible to the community.</p>

                            
                        <h3>Home Healthcare Services</h3>

                            
                        <p>Home healthcare services allow patients to receive medical care in the comfort of their own homes.
